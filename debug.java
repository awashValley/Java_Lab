       Error: CalculatorWithMemory.java:1: class Calculator is public, should be declared in a file named Calculator.java

        /*Debug [Stackoverflow-Oliver Charlesworth]: 
              As the error message implies, if you declare a class as public, it needs its own .java file. 
              If you don't want to do that, then don't define it as public. 
              Otherwise, save the java file using the same name as the class name (e.g., Calculator.java).
