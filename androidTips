## How to download apk files
   1. Go to google play store and find your app
   2. Get apps ID. In this link, for example, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wdase.mariam.AOUFIEYTAJWVLEQM&hl=en
      app id would be "com.wdase.mariam.AOUFIEYTAJWVLEQM"
   3. Go to http://downloader-apk.com (this step doesn't work for firefox, but using chrome)
   4. Insert the app id in the space and click "Generate Download Link". This generates a link for download
   5. To decompile apk file, there are two options
      - option 1: using the terminal
      - option 2: using online converter (http://www.decompileandroid.com/)
